Identifies adaptation strategies consisting of beach nourishment and managed retreat using discrete dynamic programming

The model can be run from the file main.m which takes a parameter struct as an optional input. An appropriate struct can be generated using parameters.m. All other scripts perform calculations internal to the optimization and simulation procedure.

Outputs include an optimal action vector and corresponding optimal states and value function
